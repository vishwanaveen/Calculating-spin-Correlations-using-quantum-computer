Project Title: Calculating Spin Correlations using IBM Quantum Computer
Project Description
The aim of this project is to calculate spin correlations using IBM Quantum Computer. This project uses Python and IBM Quantum Experience to perform the calculations. The project uses the Qiskit library to develop and run the quantum circuits on IBM Quantum Experience. The spin correlations are calculated using the Quantum Correlation Functions.

Installation and Dependencies
Download and install Python 3.7 or later version.
Install Qiskit using pip command pip install qiskit.
Create an account on IBM Quantum Experience.
Install IBM Quantum Experience provider using the command pip install IBMQuantumExperience.
Clone this repository by running the following command: git clone https://github.com/<username>/<project-name>.git
Usage
Create an IBM Quantum Experience account.
Configure the API token by following the instructions given on the IBM Quantum Experience website.
Set the desired number of qubits and number of shots in the config dictionary in the main.py file.
Run the main.py file using the command python main.py.
The output will be displayed on the console.
